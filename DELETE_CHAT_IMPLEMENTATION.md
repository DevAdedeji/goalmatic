# Delete Chat Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds the ability to delete chat sessions with automatic cleanup of associated storage files. The feature includes both frontend UI components and a backend Firebase function that handles secure deletion.

## Features

- **Secure Deletion**: Only authenticated users can delete their own chat sessions
- **Storage Cleanup**: Automatically removes associated media files from Firebase Storage
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Users must confirm before deletion to prevent accidental loss
- **Real-time Updates**: Chat history updates immediately after deletion
- **Navigation Handling**: Redirects users if they're viewing a deleted chat
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Firebase Function)

**File**: `backend/functions/src/deleteChatSession.ts`

The Firebase function:
1. Authenticates the user
2. Verifies ownership of the chat session
3. Extracts file paths from chat messages
4. Deletes associated storage files
5. Removes the chat session document
6. Returns success status with deletion count

**Security Features**:
- User authentication required
- Ownership verification
- File path validation (only user's own files)
- Graceful error handling for missing files

### Frontend Implementation

#### Chat History Composable

**File**: `frontend/src/composables/dashboard/assistant/messaging/chatHistory.ts`

Added functions:
- `deleteChatSession()`: Calls the Firebase function and updates local state
- `confirmDeleteSession()`: Shows confirmation dialog with session details

#### Chat History Component

**File**: `frontend/src/components/assistant/ChatHistory.vue`

UI Changes:
- Added delete button (trash icon) to each chat session
- Delete button appears on hover (desktop) or is always visible (mobile)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Success/error notifications

**Styling Features**:
- Smooth animations for delete button appearance
- Hover effects with red color scheme
- Mobile-responsive design
- Prevents accidental clicks with click.stop

## File Structure

```
whatsapp-media/
├── {userId}/
│   ├── {sessionId}/
│   │   ├── image/
│   │   │   └── {uuid}.jpg
│   │   └── audio/
│   │       └── {uuid}.ogg
```

When a chat session is deleted, all files under `whatsapp-media/{userId}/{sessionId}/` are removed.

## Usage

1. **Access**: Open chat history sidebar in the agent interface
2. **Delete**: Hover over a chat session to reveal the delete button
3. **Confirm**: Click the delete button and confirm in the dialog
4. **Result**: Chat and associated files are permanently removed

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can delete chats
- **Authorization**: Users can only delete their own chat sessions
- **File Validation**: Only files owned by the user are deleted
- **Error Isolation**: File deletion errors don't prevent chat deletion
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for debugging

## Error Handling

- **Missing Files**: Logged as warnings, don't block deletion
- **Network Errors**: User-friendly error messages
- **Permission Errors**: Clear feedback about authorization issues
- **Partial Failures**: Chat deletion succeeds even if some files fail

## Testing

To test the functionality:

1. **Create Test Chat**: Send messages with media to create a chat session
2. **Verify Storage**: Check Firebase Storage for uploaded files
3. **Delete Chat**: Use the delete button in chat history
4. **Verify Cleanup**: Confirm both chat and files are removed
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Try deleting non-existent chats, unauthorized access

## Future Enhancements

- **Bulk Deletion**: Select multiple chats for deletion
- **Soft Delete**: Move to trash before permanent deletion
- **Export Before Delete**: Allow users to export chat history
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old chats
- **Storage Quotas**: Per-user storage limits and cleanup

## Dependencies

- Firebase Functions v2
- Firebase Storage Admin SDK
- Frontend: Vue 3, Lucide Vue Next icons
- Confirmation modal composable
- Alert notification system

## Deployment

1. Deploy Firebase function: `firebase deploy --only functions`
2. Update frontend: Standard deployment process
3. Test in production environment
4. Monitor logs for any issues

## Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:
- Function execution time
- Storage deletion success rate
- User error reports
- Storage usage reduction
- Function error rates
